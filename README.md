# Starscape System Finder
This is a script for the roblox game starscape that helps with finding the system indicated in an ancient beacon.

## How To Use
After you get the files ~~using git clone or zip file~~ all your work is gonna be in the input.lua file you don't have to touch the other 2.

It's time to input the information from the ancient beacon we'll take ths image as an example:

Now my code instead of using colors it uses letters so instead of color red there's a letter here's a list of all the colors:

So the system we want to find is the one with a white circle around it and it's colour is red and is represented by the letter M so we put M inside the `""` in `main_color` remember always put the system you want to find in the `main_color`, then we put the letters for the systems linked to that main system so we end up with something like this:

if you run out of space in the `link = {"", ""}` just add more by putting a coma `,` first and then `""` and you should end up with a result, in this case we ended up with 2:

now you just need to search for these 2 in the galaxy map and see which one fits the ancient beacon, this isn't perfect but it is better than searching with your eyes hope you enjoy using this, bye.
